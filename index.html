    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Angelo Kodra and I am a 3rd year Computer Science student @ Wayne State
      University. I have had a strong interest in computers and technology since I was young,
      and this was the main reason I decided to pursue this path. Here, you can find my 
      portfolio.

      <h3>Advanced Repair Agent - Best Buy - Geek Squad</h3>
      <p><strong>Duration:</strong> October 2022 - present</p>
      <p>
        At Geek Squad, I consult and educate clients on service options and pricing. I 
        mainly diagnose, repair, and provide service for Windows/Mac PCs and Android/iOS
        devices. This includes data backups/clones/recovery, replacing/repairing hardware
        and software, building custom PCs, and more. Daily, I professionally note the work
        performed and future recommendations for coworkers and clients. During my time here,
        I have also trained onboarding agents.

      <h3>Teaching Assistant (BE 1200) - Wayne State University - College of Engineering</h3>
      <p><strong>Duration:</strong> August 2023 - present</p>
      <p>
        As a teaching assistant for BE 1200, I aided in lecturing and assisting students
        with creating and analyzing approaches to 3D modeling with NX and creating
        Arduino circuits and code. I also used 3D printers and 3D printing software
        to print manufactured designs. To assist students, I created help guides for students
        to learn different Arduino parts and functions. I coordinated and guided student groups
        for their final project.

      <h3>Digital Windex (ongoing)</h3>
      <p>
        I conceptualized and proposed the idea for Digital Windex, which was selected
        among a group of student submissions and presentations. With my group, we are
        developing a user-friendly all-in-one Windows maintenance tool to automate system 
        diagnostics, repair, and optimizations. We use Visual Studio 2022, including
        C#, .NET, and WPF, focusing on a jargon-free, modular design for non-technical 
        users. We plan to consolidate existing Windows tools including DISM, Windows
         Memory Diagnostics, Windows Update, and more in the program.
